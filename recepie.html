            <h3>with Kale Rice and Roasted Carrots</h3>
            <h3>45 Minutes</h3>

            <p>We're amping up chicken breasts with a glaze of smoky ancho chile paste
            and fresh orange juice in this recipe. On the side, roasted carrots and
            lightly creamy, golden raisin-studded rice perfectly accent the
            sweetness of the glaze.</p>

<div class="Instructions-container">
    <div class="step">
        <img src="images/Step1.jpg" alt="Cook the rice">
        <h2>1. Cook the rice:</h2>
            <p>Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, 
            then preheat to 450°F. In a medium pot, combine 
            the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of water.
            Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and
            reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or
            until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender.
            Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.
        </p>

    <div class="step">
        <img src="images/step-2.jpg" alt="Prepare the ingredients">
            <h2>2. Prepare the ingredients & make the glaze:</h2>
            <p>While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce.
                Peel the carrots; quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise.
                Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Remove and discard the stems
                of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a peeler, remove
                the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2 teaspoons
                of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve
                the orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any
                seeds. Whisk in the chile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until
                smooth.

    <div class="step">
        <img src="images/Step-3.jpg" alt="Roast the carrots">
            <h2>3. Roast the carrots:</h2>
            <p>Place the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with
                olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat.
                Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or
                until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.
            </p>

    <div class="step">
        <img src="images/Step-4.jpg" alt="Cook the kale">
            <h2>4. Cook the kale:</h2>
            <p>While the carrots roast, in a large pan
                (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive
                oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic
                and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or
                until fragrant. Add the chopped kale; season with salt
                and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes,
                or until slightly wilted. Add 1/3 cup of water; season
                with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to
                4 minutes, or until the kale has wilted and the water has
                cooked off. Transfer to the pot of cooked rice. Stir to
                combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover to
                keep warm. Wipe out the pan.

    <div class="step">
        <img src="images/step-5.jpg" alt="Cook and glaze the chicken">
            <h2>5. Cook and glaze the chicken:</h2>
            <p>While the carrots continue to roast, pat the chicken dry
                with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both
                sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on
                medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4
                to 6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. Flip and
                cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the glaze
                and cook, frequently spooning the glaze over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes,
                or until the chicken is coated and cooked through. Turn off the heat;
                stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into the glaze until
                the butter has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </p>

    <div class="step">
        <img src="images/step-6.jpg" alt="Finish the rice">
            <h2>6. Finish the rice and serve your dish:</h2>
            <p>To the pot of cooked rice and kale, add the lime zest,
                crème fraîche, raisins, and the juice of the remaining
                lime half. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper
                to taste. Serve the glazed chicken with the finished rice and
                roasted carrots. Top the chicken with the remaining glaze from
                the pan. Enjoy!
